                A content management system costs different amounts. Some are

                CMS charge a monthly fee, while others only charge for hosting.
                The cost of a content management system can vary greatly
                depending on your needs.

                A content management system (CMS) by Wikipedia is defined as "a

                content, data, and applications based on their permission
