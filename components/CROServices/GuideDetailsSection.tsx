            What exactly is conversion rate optimization (CRO)?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Conversion rate optimization (CRO) is the procedure of testing and
            updating website elements in order to increase the percentage of
            website visitors who take actions that result in them becoming
            customers. CRO services assist you in effectively utilizing website
            traffic to improve your company's bottom line.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-16">
          <p className="text-4xl font-bold mb-10">
            Why is CRO important for your website?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Each website has its own set of goals. A lead generation website
            generates leads, an e-commerce store sells products, and a blog
            converts visitors into subscribers. <br />
            <br /> Unfortunately, many web sites owners don't pay as much
            attention to how well they're achieving those goals, as they should,
            and many marketers measure success as a result of traffic and
            rankings rather than conversions.
            <br />
            <br /> However, these are "vanity metrics" — they look great on
            paper, and it's nice to be able to submit a certain number of
            monthly visitors. But, at the end, which one would you prefer:
            10,000 monthly website visitors and $1,000 in sales, or 1,000
            monthly visitors and $10,000 in sales?
            <br />
            <br /> That is an easy question for most marketers to answer, but
            achieving that number would actually require maximizing conversions.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <img src={banner1.src} className="mb-8" />
          <p className="text-lg">
            If you're not familiar with the term, a conversion is any action
            that moves a site visitor closer to becoming a customer, and your
            conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who transform. <br />
            <br /> But, if your company ignores conversion rate optimization,
            you're missing out on an opportunity to maximize the effectiveness
            of your website as a marketing and sales tool. <br />
            <br /> Because Internet marketing is so data-driven, it's easy to
            get caught up in metrics like traffic and rankings. Monitoring and
            improving your conversion rate, on the other hand, is more effective
            for driving the metrics that really matter, such as sales and
            revenue. <br />
            <br /> That is why conversion rate optimization, or CRO, has grown
            in importance — it empowers you to identify what isn't working, why,
            and how to fix it. <br />
            <br /> The sales funnel refers to your entire sales process, from
            generating interest to convincing potential customers that they need
            your product or service to finally closing the sale. Identifying
            "leaks" in this funnel can have a significant impact on the
            performance of your site. <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <img src={banner2.src} className="mb-8" />
          <p className="text-lg">
            For example, you may have 1,000 potential new customers enter your
            sales funnel at the start, but only 5 of them may end up purchasing
            your product or service. This translates to a 0.5 percent conversion
            rate and implies that your sales funnel needs to be patched up
            (depending on the industry and a few other factors).
            <br />
            <br /> We'll go through your sales funnel and identify weak points
            with our conversion analysis process. Perhaps your landing pages
            need to be redesigned, or you should test new copy for your
            call-to-action buttons. Perhaps it's something more subtle, and you
            need to present a more accurate representation of your products.{" "}
            <br />
            <br /> It could be anything, and our job is to figure out what it is
            and how to fix it.

              on all pages of a website. <br />
              <br /> Visitors may become confused and leave if any of your pages
              deviate from the look of your site. Other issues, such as broken
              links or complex navigation bars, can also lead to abandonment.{" "}
              <br />
              <br /> Ensuring that all of your site's pages conform to your
              brand and that no aesthetic errors exist will increase the amount
              of time visitors spend on your site, greatly increasing your
