        To complement a results-driven content marketing strategy on social
        media, our Social Media Plans provide advertising management for boosted
        posts exclusively. Other ads, such as traffic ads, lead ads, shopping
        feed ads, marketplace ads, etc., are not included in the advertising. In
        addition to the content management campaign, any additional ads—aside
        from boosted posts and sponsored content—that are produced or exceed the
        limit ad spend level require a full social media advertising campaign.
