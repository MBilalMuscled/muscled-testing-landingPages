          <h2>What is direct-to-consumer social media advertising?</h2>
          <p>
            A great way to boost your D2C business are paid social media ads
            that will increase your exposure on social media platforms. With the
            social media algorithms constantly changing it is harder to reach
            and engage with your customers organically through their news feeds.
            Paid advertisements will immediately raise awareness of your brand
            and products.
