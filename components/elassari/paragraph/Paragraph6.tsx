        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But how do we develop our prestigious websites? by adhering to the five
        web design tenets.
      </p>
      <h4>Appearance </h4>
      <p>
        The first step in gaining new consumers is building a stunning website.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Visitors learn more about your business from the look of your website
        than they do from the content. A website that uses contemporary design
        features, optimised photos, and other multimedia converts visitors
        considerably more effectively than one that appears like it was created
        in 1996.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        As a result, your website's aesthetic is extremely important to its
        success!
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Including responsive design on your site is another aspect of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        With the use of responsive design, your website may automatically adjust
        its size to meet any screen size. Therefore, visitors to your site will
        still have a wonderful, user-friendly experience whether they're using
        an iPhone or a 27-inch desktop display.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        The first stage in acquiring a new customer is that experience, which is
        frequently referred to as user experience. It's simple to retain users
        on your site when they notice how slick and appealing it is. But a
        visually appealing website is just the start. Also required is
        straightforward navigation.
      </p>
      <h4>Navigation</h4>
      <p>
        The section of your website's navigation that helps visitors locate what
        they're looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        To work on desktops and mobile devices, modern websites have streamlined
        their navigation. The breadcrumb is one of the most well-liked and
        useful navigational components. Check out the illustration below for an
        illustration of a breadcrumb.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Because it links to each page a visitor visits as they browse your
        website, breadcrumb navigation earned its name. It is similar to how
        Hansel and Gretel in their fairy tale left a trail of breadcrumbs for
        the reader to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Users of your website can return to any page they've previously seen by
        using the breadcrumb navigation. So, if you run an online store, you can
        enable one-click navigation from a product page to a category page.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        You can use breadcrumbs to direct visitors from information pages to
        index pages if your business relies on lead generation so they can read
        and learn more about the same subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        A breadcrumb menu, for instance, might be used in a manufacturing
        website design to direct customers from general to specific services,
        such as coating services and then coating services for particular
        materials. Users may quickly return to the main service page and locate
        the service they require thanks to the breadcrumb menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        But breadcrumbs are only the start. Mega menus, like the one in our
        header, are another option. Large text, links to information centres,
        and supplementary links to specialised topics are all included in these
        menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        There is no right or wrong response because there are hundreds of
        distinct navigational methods accessible. When it comes to giving your
        users a fantastic experience, it's all about what works for your brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Another advantage of giving them a wonderful experience is that you keep
        their attention.
      </p>
      <h4>Attention </h4>
      {/* <ul className="pl-8 list-disc"> */}
      <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          {" "}
          It's essential to hold a visitor's interest after they land on your
          website. If you falter, the visitor will abandon your website and you
          won't get the sale.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          {" "}
          Because it retains someone's attention on your company, products, or
          services, attention is valuable. Therefore, you need someone to visit
          your website in order to make a sale.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          {" "}
          In light of this, many businesses can capture interest in various
          ways, such as:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          {" "}
          Video content - Given that video is a visually stimulating medium,
          video marketing is very successful at grabbing someone's attention.
          Using video instead of making viewers read lengthy pages of text
          allows you to concisely explain complicated ideas in a matter of
          minutes. Text can become monotonous after a short while, but videos
          keep viewers interested the entire time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          {" "}
          Downloads - Another excellent technique to hold someone's interest is
          to provide them downloadable content. The majority of downloads can
          come in the form of a text-based PDF that is jam-packed with insider
          knowledge or a resource-filled.zip file. Because you can gate it and
          require an email address before someone can download the papers, this
          content is excellent for generating new leads as well.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          {" "}
          Infographics - By providing industry-related data with streamlined,
          clear representations, infographics maintain viewers' attention. You
          may still gain traffic, attention, and links for infographics even
          when there are hundreds of new ones published every day by pushing
          yourself to a higher standard of quality than your rivals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          {" "}
          It's time to provide your visitors a sense of direction on your page
          after you have their attention.
        </li>
      </ul>
      {/* </ul> */}
      <h4>Direction </h4>
      <p>
        The term "direction" relates to pointing out how a user might go forward
        on your page; often, this instructs a user to scroll down your page. The
        most popular method of progression on websites is vertical scrolling
        since it is straightforward, easy to use, and practical.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        The problem arises when your mobile site design incorporates vertical
        scrolling.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src={Direction.src} alt={Direction.src} />
      </div>
      <p>
        Mobile users use your fingers to navigate your page, whereas desktop
        users use a mouse or scrollbar. As a result, visitors of your
        mobile-friendly pages can scroll just like those of your desktop version
        by simply tapping, holding, and swiping.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        The responsive design principle is referenced by this design element.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        All of your website visitors may have the same wonderful experience
        thanks to responsive design, but how they do so differs greatly. Your
        desktop-compatible website may include a header with huge navigation, a
        lot of drop-down menus, and large, attention-grabbing graphics.
      </p>
      <p> But for a mobile site, that is too much content in one place.</p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        An alternative navigation method for mobile sites is the hamburger menu,
        which enables visitors to tap a button to open a menu and select their
        next page from there. The name of the hamburger menu comes from its
        recognisable icon. It may resemble something like this, which you might
        recognise:
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Mobile customers may access any area of your website easily with a
        hamburger menu.
      </p>
      <h4>Action</h4>
      <p>
        The ultimate objective of bringing any new visitor to your website is
        action. But if you don't motivate visitors, they won't act! The
        implementation of calls-to-action (CTAs) at the conclusion of each page
        on your website is crucial for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        A CTA serves as instructions, outlining what site visitors should do
        next to move the conversion process along. Despite the fact that it may
        sound arrogant, studies show that CTAs significantly enhance conversions
        across all online business models, from lead generation to charitable
        donations.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        CTAs must be included in your web design if you want to encourage
        visitors to contact you or make a purchase. Because of this, our team of
        copywriters creates effective CTAs to support your online marketing
        objectives, such as raising the number of email subscribers or driving
        more sales.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src={Increase.src} alt={Increase.src} />
      </div>
      <p>
        CTAs come in the following varieties: The Muscled web design team has
        perfected the process of creating performance-driven websites, which
        involves time, revisions, and editing. Our web designers will build a
        website that adheres to these five principles in your best interests in
        order to ensure your success online.
