          Inside our ecommerce SEO services
        </Typography.Heading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          You want to make sure that you are attracting the correct kind of
          clients to your website when you start selling products online
          utilizing web marketing. You may do this by ensuring that your content
          is of the proper kind and contains the appropriate keywords. <br />
          <br /> Because search engines rely on matching search phrases to terms
          on your website, SEO for an e-commerce website should include material
          that is useful and evocative.
          <br />
          <br /> You have a higher chance of being discovered if your website
          contains the keywords that customers enter into search engines. In
          fact, after conducting a search, more than 50% of users discover a new
          business or item.
          <br />
          <br /> However, it might be difficult to decide which words to add to
          your website and, secondly, how to make sure that there is enough
          space for all the various phrases you want. You should be aware of the
          keywords or phrases you wish to target before beginning the ecommerce
          search engine optimization procedure.
          <br />
          <br />
          What to anticipate while working with our in-house team of ecommerce
          SEO professionals is outlined below, along with how we begin our
          ecommerce SEO process for our customers.
        </Typography.Body>
        <Typography.SubHeading className="mb-10">
          1. Identification of keyword
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-5">
          We initially do research to determine the terms and phrases you need
          to use in your content before making any adjustments to your website.
          These are referred to as key phrases or keywords.
          <br />
          <br /> We'll figure out how you should describe your business or items
          to rank well in searches by utilizing keyword research tools, asking
          your consumers how they would describe your products, or working with
          you to uncover the keywords you already know are successful.
          <br />
          <br /> The majority of the time, keywords are related to your store's
          main concept or its items. For example, you can choose to target
          keywords with an emphasis on eco-friendly pet items. "Eco-friendly pet
          items," "eco-friendly dog toys," and "eco-friendly dog harness" are a
          few examples.
        </Typography.Body>
        <img src={banner5.src} className="mb-5" />
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          The distinctive qualities of your business may help improve other
          facets of your e-commerce SEO. For example, if you spend money on
          content marketing, you may write blog entries on dangerous ingredients
          in dog food. You may use the term "bad additives in dog food" to
          target that kind of post.
          <br />
          <br /> Because it creates an effective plan for your company, keyword
          research is a crucial component of our ecommerce SEO services.
        </Typography.Body>
        <Typography.SubHeading className="mb-10">
          2. Implementation of keyword
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          We will then include these valuable, pertinent keywords onto your
          website as the following stage in our process.
          <br />
          <br /> These keywords are used often by our ecommerce SEO specialists,
          including:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>Homepage</li>
            <li>Page Titles</li>
            <li>Meta descriptions</li>
            <li>Product descriptions</li>
            <li>Image alt text</li>
            <li>And more</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          The success of an ecommerce SEO strategy depends on this stage. It's
          challenging for search engines — and even consumers — to recognize
          that your website is related to a search query without optimizing it
          for these important keywords. <br />
          <br /> Although you may write your own text to incorporate these
          suggested keywords, working with a full-service digital marketing firm
          like Muscled offers the benefit of our SEO copywriting services. Take
          notice that certain copywriting is already included in our ecommerce
          SEO packages. <br />
          <br />
          If you want to use our copywriting services for ecommerce SEO, we have
          a skilled group of copywriters that have expertise in a variety of
          industries, including manufacturing, retail, and automotive. We
          develop material using their knowledge that is not only well-written
          but also consistent with your brand.
        </Typography.Body>
        <Typography.SubHeading className="mb-10">
          3. Optimization of product page
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-5">
          Your website has to be optimized for search engines on every page.
          <br />
          <br />
          It's difficult to think of anything more crucial to optimize for
          ecommerce companies than product pages. Because they are most likely
          to appear in search results for exceedingly specialized search terms,
          commonly referred to as "long-tail keywords," product pages are of
          utmost importance.
          <br />
          <br /> You probably won't have the long-tail keyword "green rubber dog
          bone" on your site if you offer green rubber dog bones. Instead, you
          would concentrate on optimizing product pages for these relevant
          long-tail keywords as part of your e-commerce SEO strategy.
          <br />
          <br /> We'll make sure that each page on your product pages has a
          title and a few sentences of keyword-rich material that explains the
          product in order to guarantee that they rank highly in search results.
          In order to appear in searches for the model number (if there is one),
          it is also a good idea to mention it.
        </Typography.Body>
        <img src={banner6.src} className="mb-5" />
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          Images of the products you are offering should be included on your
          product pages as well because both visitors and search engines
          appreciate them. Your product's dimensions, color scheme, and intended
          applications are all put into context for users through your photos.
          Your photos give search engines information about the context of your
          product page. <br />
          <br /> It's vital to remember, though, that optimizing photos for
          search engines is essential. Images cannot be "read" by Google, Bing,
          Yahoo, or any other search engine. To interpret pictures, they rely on
          the image filename, image alt text, and adjacent material. <br />
          <br /> Our devoted staff optimizes your photos for SEO for this
          reason. Additionally, we thoroughly examine each page of your website
          to make sure that long-tail keywords are being targeted and that
          essential SEO components like title tags are included. A product page
          that is ready to convert customers is the end result.
        </Typography.Body>
        <Typography.SubHeading className="mb-10">
          4. Navigation optimization
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          Making your website user-friendly is also a component of SEO for
          ecommerce sites. Even if you sell a wide range of items, you still
          need an easy-to-use website. We'll make sure that everything has the
          proper sections or categories and that your menu contains a link to
          every top-level page.
          <br />
          <br /> Your navigation must also be simple to use and comprehend. If
          not, you can discover that visitors become lost and quit your website
          practically immediately after they arrive. If they can't get what they
          desire, why stay? This abrupt departure, often known as a "bounce,"
          may increase the bounce rate.
          <br />
          <br /> High bounce rates might cause a reduction in your results since
          they signal to search engines that your website isn't as relevant for
          the search phrases it's ranking for. Because of this, web design and
          landing page design are essential components of ecommerce SEO.
          <br />
          <br /> Using breadcrumb navigation is one of the finest techniques
          we've found to boost SEO for e-commerce.
          <br />
          <br /> Small links called breadcrumbs can be seen at the top of a
          menu, category, or product page. Similar to the tale of Hansel and
          Gretel, a website's breadcrumb trail will take you back to your prior
          location.
          <br />
          <br /> This technique will be used by our talented web designers to
          enhance your pages' usability for visitors by adding links and
          keywords. We provide user experience testing services for the best
          outcomes in the usability of your website.
        </Typography.Body>
        <Typography.SubHeading className="mb-10">
          5. Content creation
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-[60px]">
          Making fresh content for your ecommerce site is one of the finest
          strategies to increase SEO value and attract customers because it's
          challenging to compete online. A blog, articles, press releases, and
          even ebooks are all examples of content.
          <br />
          <br /> A content marketing plan has two goals: to show potential
          consumers that you are competent and dependable, and to provide search
          engines even more information to crawl for keywords and phrases.
          <br />
          <br /> The best thing is that content marketing may increase website
          conversion rates by a factor of two. Why? By providing consumers with
          original and educational content, you add value by guiding them or
          providing answers to their inquiries.
          <br />
          <br />
          More than 60% of visitors appreciate businesses that provide unique
          content, which may help your e-commerce company stand out from
          competitors in your field. Because of this, organizations who employ
          content marketing see a more than quadrupling of their conversion
          rates compared to those who don't.
          <br />
          <br /> Most e-commerce websites decide to create a blog for content
          marketing purposes. A blog might have one post per month or several
          postings per day, and they come in all different sizes and forms. You
          might find it best to concentrate on one or two postings a week for
          your online store. <br />
          <br /> Anything that your readers could find interesting to read
          about, such as new goods or trends in your business, is fair game. You
          might even hold a competition to determine which pet among your
          customers is the cutest if you offer pet supplies.
          <br />
          <br /> Additional content may include:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Videos for how-tos on product maintenance or uses</li>
            <li>Infographics on topics related to your products or industry</li>
            <li>Articles about industry topics you are knowledgeable about</li>
            <li>Long-form content like ebooks or white papers</li>
          </ul>
          <br />

          Why do ecommerce businesses need SEO?
        </Typography.Heading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-[60px]">
          Businesses across a wide range of sectors may benefit from SEO in a
          number of ways, and ecommerce organizations in particular should
          prioritize it. <br />
          <br />
          You may reach more qualified leads with ecommerce SEO. These customers
          are most likely to purchase your goods, increasing your company's
          sales and revenue. By making your website keyword-optimized for this
          particular group of consumers, SEO enables you to attract their
          business. <br />
          <br /> These terms frequently have something to do with your shop or
          goods. <br />
          <br /> It seems to reason that these terms would appear in people's
          searches if you offer embroidered cat collars, for instance.
          Therefore, keywords like "embroidered cat collars" or "engraved cat
          collars" would probably be targeted by your e-commerce SEO strategy.
          <br />
          <br />
          These are search terms that are pertinent to both your company and
          your intended audience.

          Ecommerce SEO connects you with high-value shoppers
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          Although your potential consumers are prepared to part with their
          hard-earned money, without SEO, they might not even be aware that your
          shop even exists. To ensure that your business is seen by as many
          customers as possible, use our ecommerce SEO services.
          <br />
          <br /> Ecommerce SEO is the equivalent of putting a large sign that
          reads, "We carry dog toys!" in front of a physical business.
          <br />
          <br /> "or "We provide cat necessities for sale!

          <br /> Your likelihood of appearing in searches for keywords with
          strong purchase intent is minimal to none without optimizing your
          website for these key phrases.
          <br />
          <br /> Instead, it's your rivals who do, and they are glad to take on
          your clients.

          Ecommerce SEO optimizes your entire product line

        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          Even if you give customers a more limited variety and operate an
          online store, it's still important that your target market easily
          locate your products while conducting internet searches. Each of your
          items is optimized with our ecommerce SEO services.
          <br />
          <br /> The outcome? The terms "memory foam dog bed" and "orthopedic
          cat bed" are used by users to reach your website and your goods. Even
          better, they discover what they're seeking for, resulting in another
          online purchase for your company.
          <br />
          <br /> In contrast, if your business relied on traditional marketing,
          you would have to limit your product marketing to one or two, unless
          you had a sizable budget. Even if you would undoubtedly promote your
          best-selling items, you couldn't be sure you would get in front of
          your intended market.
          <br />
          <br /> You may improve your website to target your most qualified
          consumers with ecommerce SEO services.

          Ecommerce SEO improves your online visibility
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          The goal of ecommerce SEO is to increase your website's visibility to
          search engines. Ecommerce SEO makes it simpler for customers to locate
          your website by enhancing your visibility. Your website now appears on
          page one of search results rather than page two.
          <br />
          <br /> If you ignore SEO, your company is exposed to a number of
          problems, such as:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
            <li>Lower search result rankings</li>
            <li>Fewer purchase orders</li>
            <li>Less revenue</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          All of these hazards have an effect on both your everyday operations
          and your bottom line. Your website won't generate purchases if you
          aren't bringing in quality visitors, which lowers your overall
          profitability. That cannot continue.
          <br />
          <br /> We increase your exposure in search results with the use of our
          ecommerce SEO services, along with aggressive and cutting-edge
          tactics. Because of this, our staff takes the time to learn about your
          company, from your customers to your goods, and then develops a
          tailored approach that produces results.

          Ecommerce SEO is a cost-effective marketing strategy
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          Ecommerce SEO is incredibly cost-effective when compared to
          conventional marketing. SEO helps you reach the outcomes you desire by
          concentrating on the terms your target audience uses and optimizing
          your website for those keywords. <br />
          <br /> It serves as the cornerstone of a potent, performance-based
          digital marketing approach. <br />
          <br /> Your firm may reinvest in the growth of its business with the
          money it saves through SEO. Consider adding email marketing or
          pay-per-click (PPC) advertising to your e-commerce marketing plan,
          both of which have a high return on investment (ROI).

          Ecommerce SEO provides long-term revenue
        </Typography.SubHeading>
        <Typography.Body className="mb-10">
          With a closure rate of nearly 15%, SEO provides a steady and long-term
          source of revenue for your business. This means that 15% of all leads
          will convert. Because of this, SEO is a long-term and continuous
          process that yields benefits gradually rather than immediately.
          <br />
          <br />
          Although 15 percent may not seem all that impressive, it is eight
          times more than the close rate of 1.7 percent achieved by traditional
          marketing. That's a poor close rate, especially in light of the annual
          expenditures your business makes on conventional marketing.
          <br />
          <br /> Another justification for why e-commerce businesses are
          increasingly turning to digital marketing is this.
          <br />
          <br /> Your business might expand over time if ecommerce SEO results
          are consistent. That equates to meeting your business's long-term
          objectives, which can involve growing your product line, your
          workforce, or hitting your ideal sales target.
          <br />
          <br /> The best aspect is that, unlike PPC, ecommerce SEO doesn't cost
          anything to achieve results. While the two services complement one
          another effectively, you are still charged for each click that PPC
          brings in for your business. That lowers your total ROI and revenue.
          Additionally, it forces your company to rely on sponsored advertising
          for income.

          Ecommerce SEO helps you compete against competitors

        <Typography.Body>
          Expect your competition to outrank you in search results if you don't
          have an ecommerce SEO plan and a top SEO company.
          <br />
          <br /> A rival with a strong ecommerce SEO firm will outrank you
          virtually always, in every search, even if you have an incredible
          ecommerce website with a stunning design that organically draws
          hundreds of links. Having only a portion of the bundle is
          insufficient.
          <br />
          <br /> Online competition is fierce, so you need the full package.
          With a customized ecommerce SEO package from Muscled, you get just
          that. As your partner, we will create a unique and aggressive plan
          that will put you at the top of your sector.
